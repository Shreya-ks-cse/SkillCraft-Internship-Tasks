 Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my internship at SkillCraft Technologies.  
I performed Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Microsoft Excel.

 🔍 Steps Performed

 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in Age (replaced with average)
- Filled Embarked with the most frequent value
- Removed Cabin due to excessive missing data
- Removed duplicate entries

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed survival distribution
- Compared survival rates based on gender and class
- Created bar charts to visualize patterns

 📊 Key Insights
- More passengers did not survive than survived
- **Females** had a higher survival rate than males
- **1st class** passengers had better survival chances

 📎 Files Included
- `Titanic_EDA.xlsx` — Excel file with cleaned data and analysis  
- `Titanic_EDA_Chart.png` — Survival count bar chart  

🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and visualization

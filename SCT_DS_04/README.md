# 🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis – SkillCraft Internship Task 04

This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify important patterns related to:

- Weather conditions  
- Road conditions  
- Time-of-day trends  
- Accident hotspots  

The dataset used includes fields such as Date, Time, Weather Condition, Road Condition, Accident Severity, Latitude, and Longitude.


## 📊 Analysis Performed

### 1. Accidents by Weather Condition
Bar chart showing how different weather types affect accident frequency.

### 2. Accidents by Road Condition
Analyzes accident counts on dry, wet, icy, and snowy roads.

### 3. Hourly Accident Trend
Histogram showing accident frequency throughout the day.

### 4. Accident Hotspot Map
Scatter plot visualizing accident-prone geographic locations.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab  

## 📁 Project Files
- `accident_data.csv` 
- `accident_analysis.ipynb` 
- Charts and Visualizations

## 📝 Conclusion
The analysis shows that:
- Accidents increase during rainy and snowy weather  
- Wet and icy roads pose higher risk  
- Peak accident times occur during morning and evening rush hours  
- Accident hotspots are clustered in high-traffic urban zones
